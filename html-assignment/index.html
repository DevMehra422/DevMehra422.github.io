                My name is Devjeet Singh and i am from India.I landed in Ottawa last month on 19th of december.I am 21 year old.I have done a three year advanced diploma in computer science and engineering from India.I had a keen interest towards Ui/Ux, Web-Development, digital graphics and motion graphics that's why I chose interactive media design in Algonquin college.

                I chose Ottawa for my studies over other cities like toronto and brampton as Ottawa is a laid back and peaceful city as compared to other cities.I am still adjusting to the cold here as it is my first winter in Canada.I also liked how the whole faculty is so supportive towards students and understand that how difficult it can be to be a international student.
